<h1> $\color{yellow}\text{Medical Image Analysis | Digital Pathology}$ </h1>

<!--Goals for Digital Pathology and Medical Image Analysis with AI and Neural Networks-->

<li> <b>Boost Diagnostic Precision:</b> Build AI tools that help doctors spot and classify diseases in pathology slides and medical images more accurately than traditional approaches. </li><br>
<li> <b>Simplify Tissue Mapping:</b> Create neural networks to automatically outline tissues, cells, and abnormalities, making analysis faster and easier for pathologists. </li><br>
<li> <b>Speed Up Analysis:</b> Design AI systems that process high-resolution images quickly, supporting near-instant results for clinical use. </li><br>
<li> <b>Work Across Diverse Cases:</b> Train AI to handle differences in imaging equipment, staining methods, and patient backgrounds for reliable results. </li><br>
<li> <b>Predict Health Outcomes:</b> Use neural networks to forecast disease progression or treatment success based on image patterns. </li><br>
<li> <b>Blend Multiple Data Types:</b>  Combine images with patient records, genetic info, and other data to provide deeper insights for doctors. </li><br>
<li> <b>Make AI Transparent:</b>  Develop AI that clearly explains its findings, helping clinicians trust and understand its recommendations. </li><br>
<li> <b>Handle Large Workloads:</b>  Create cloud-based AI solutions to manage massive pathology datasets for hospitals and clinics. </li><br>
<li> <b>Meet Medical Standards:</b>  Ensure AI tools comply with healthcare regulations for safe and effective use in clinics. </li>
